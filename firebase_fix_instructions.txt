🔥 FIREBASE DEPENDENCY FIX INSTRUCTIONS 🔥
=====================================================

The project is missing FirebaseAuth and FirebaseDatabase products.
Follow these steps to fix the issue:

1. Open BloodConnect.xcodeproj in Xcode
   (Project file should already be open)

2. In Xcode, navigate to:
   - Click on BloodConnect project in Project Navigator (left sidebar)
   - Select BloodConnect target
   - Go to "Package Dependencies" tab

3. Select the existing Firebase package and click the "-" button to remove it
   (We'll re-add it with the correct dependencies)

4. Click the "+" button to add the Firebase package again:
   - Enter URL: https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git
   - Click "Next" 
   - Select the latest version
   - Make sure to select the following Firebase products:
      • FirebaseCore (usually selected automatically)
      • FirebaseAuth        ← REQUIRED
      • FirebaseFirestore   ← REQUIRED
      • FirebaseDatabase    ← REQUIRED
   - Click "Add Package"

5. Wait for the package resolution to complete

6. Clean the build folder:
   - Product > Clean Build Folder (or Shift+Command+K)

7. Build the project:
   - Product > Build (or Command+B)

This should resolve the "Missing package product" errors.

If you still have issues:
- Check the build log for additional errors
- Try closing and reopening Xcode
- Make sure the Firebase packages are properly included in your target
